# js-hack-assembler

This is a browser-based assembler written in JavaScript! It takes assembly language and spits out machine code in `.hack` files to run on the Hack computer for the free and open [NAND2Tetris course](http://nand2tetris.org/) on computer science from first principles. 

**Try it out:** http://learningnerd.github.io/js-hack-assembler/

**Note:** Don't look at the code until *after* you've already completed the project yourself! 

I decided to publish this publicly because I think there's tremendous benefit to being able to compare your finished code to somebody else's version. I hate to go against the wishes of the course instructors, but I think the risk of ruining somebody else's learning experience is minimal in this case. (Besides, complete solutions have already been posted online.)

### Blog posts on my learning process:

I experimented with keeping details notes as I went through this course. You can see the notes for this assembler here:
